      "description": "🔹 STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)\nSTLC is a step‑by‑step process followed during testing to ensure software quality. It defines how testing is planned, designed, executed, and closed.\n\nSTLC Phases (Simple & Clear)\n1. Requirement Analysis\nUnderstand what needs to be tested.\n\nIdentify testable and non‑testable requirements.\n\nClarify gaps with BA/Dev if needed.\n\n2. Test Planning\nDefine the testing strategy.\n\nEstimate effort, resources, timelines.\n\nIdentify tools and risks.\n\n3. Test Case Design\nWrite detailed test cases.\n\nPrepare test data.\n\nReview and finalize test scenarios.\n\n4. Test Environment Setup\nPrepare the environment where testing will run.\n\nInstall builds, configure servers, databases, tools.\n\n5. Test Execution\nExecute test cases.\n\nLog defects.\n\nRetest and perform regression testing.\n\n6. Test Closure\nEnsure all planned tests are completed.\n\nPrepare test summary report.\n\nEvaluate quality and lessons learned.",

      "description": "1. Performance Testing\n(Load Testing, Stress Testing, Volume Testing)\n- Load Testing:\nWe gradually increase the load — for example, 1 user, then 2 users, then 3 users, and so on — up to the required limit.\n- Stress Testing:\nWe suddenly add a high load (e.g., +20 users at once) or suddenly remove a large number of users (e.g., –100 users) to see how the system behaves under extreme conditions.\n- Volume Testing:\nWe check how much data the system can handle — how much data storage or data volume it can afford without performance issues.\n\n2. Security Testing\n(Authentication and Authorization)\n- Authentication: Verifies the user is who they claim to be (login, password, OTP).\n- Authorization: Verifies what the user is allowed to access after login (roles, permissions).\n\n3. Recovery Testing\nChecks how well the system recovers from crashes, failures, or unexpected shutdowns.\n\n4. Compatibility Testing\n- Forward Compatibility: Supports newer versions (e.g., new browser version).\n- Backward Compatibility: Supports previous versions.\n- Hardware Compatibility: Works correctly on different hardware configurations.\n\n5. Configuration Testing\nTests the application under different configurations (OS, browsers, network settings, memory, CPU, etc.).\n\n6. Installation Testing\nChecks installation and uninstallation processes to ensure they work smoothly without errors.\n\n7. Sanitation / Garbage Testing\nEnsures there are no extra or unwanted features that the customer did not request.\nExample:\nA developer adds a new page or feature that was not part of the requirement — this should be flagged.\n",

Database Testing (DML Operations) – Examples\nINSERT Example\n- Action: User registers a new account\n- Expected DB Result: A new row is inserted into users table with correct username, email, and timestamp\nUPDATE Example\n- Action: User updates their profile picture\n- Expected DB Result: profile_image column in users table is updated for that user ID\nDELETE Example\n- Action: User deletes an item from their shopping cart\n- Expected DB Result: Corresponding row is removed from cart_items table\nSELECT Example\n- Action: User logs in\n- Expected DB Result: System runs a SELECT query to fetch user credentials and returns correct user record",

Usability testing ensures the product feels natural and user‑friendly, which directly impacts adoption, satisfaction, and business success.\n",
